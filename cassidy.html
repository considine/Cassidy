					<p class="essay"><strong>What happened?</strong></p>
					<p class="essay">Notre Dame's College of Arts and Letters is the oldest college at Notre Dame. It's the academic foundation for the entire university. It's at the core of the school's distinctive mission. And ever since Notre Dame was founded, it has been the college with the largest enrollment. </p> <p> d</p>
					<p class="essay">This year, for the first time, it's not. </p> <p> d</p>
					<p class="essay">Enrollment in Arts and Letters has declined 31 percent in the last ten years, and as of this semester, Mendoza College of Business will overtake the College of Arts and Letters as the largest college at Notre Dame.</p><p> d</p>
					<p class="essay">John T. McGreevy, Dean of the College of Arts and Letters, says the largest factor in declining enrollment has been the state of the U.S. economy. "We saw a decline beginning in 2008 with the economic crash ... but we're definitely eager to get more students," he says.</p>
					<p class="essay">Since 2004, enrollment in the College of Engineering has grown by 56 percent and the Mendoza College of Business has increased by 33 percent.</p> <p> d</p>
					<p class="essay">Based on measures colleges are taking this year, the shrinking enrollment in Arts and Letters may have a chance to stabilize, but if Arts and Letters hopes to increase its enrollment, it will have to reverse the perception that its graduates aren't competitive in the job market. </p><p> d</p>

					<h1 class ="first"> Retail Rose Bowl: Gamedays at the Bookstores</h1>
					<p class="essay">They don't march down library quad with the band, but they are equally prepared on game day. When the Notre Dame Bookstore clerks take the floor, it's game on.</p>^M
					<p class="essay">On a typical home football game day, Notre Dame retail outlets do more than 50,000 transactions. For the Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore, the six home games are retail Rose Bowls.</p>^M
					<p class="essay">"We prepare like the football team," David Werda, Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore director, says. "We have a game plan. We execute, and at the end of the weekend, we'll sit down and we'll evaluate the success and the failures and the opportunities that exist for the next one."</p>^M
					<p class="essay">And just like the football team, the bookstore staff brings its A-game for swarms of cheering fans. Werda says Notre Dame season tickets have a higher turnover than any other football stadium in the country, which means new fans use those tickets every game.</p>^M
